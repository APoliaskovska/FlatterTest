  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
    - fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500
      - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
      - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Black.ttf
        weight: 900
